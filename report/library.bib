abstract = {We present a multifrequency dataset for an optically-selected, volume-limited, complete sample of 118 late-type galaxies ({\textgreater}= S0a) in the Virgo cluster. The database includes UV, visible, near-IR, mid-IR, far-IR, radio continuum photometric data as well as spectroscopic data of Halpha, CO and HI lines, homogeneously reduced, obtained from our own observations or compiled from the literature. Assuming the energy balance between the absorbed stellar light and that radiated in the IR by dust, we calibarte an empirical attenuation law suitable for correcting photometric and spectroscopic data of normal galaxies. The data, corrected for internal extinction, are used to construct the spectral energy distribution (SED) of each individual galaxy, and combined to trace the median SED of galaxies in various classes of morphological type and luminosity. Low-luminosity, dwarf galaxies have on average bluer stellar continua and higher far-IR luminosities per unit galaxy mass than giant, early-type spirals. If compared to nearby starburst galaxies such as M82 and Arp 220, normal spirals have relatively similar observed stellar spectra but 10-100 times lower IR luminosities. The temperature of the cold dust component increases with the far-IR luminosity, from giant spirals to dwarf irregulars. The SED are used to separate the stellar emission from the dust emission in the mid-IR regime. We show that the contribution of the stellar emission at 6.75 micron to the total emission of galaxies is generally important, from {\~{}} 80{\%} in Sa to {\~{}} 20{\%} in Sc.},

We propose a measure to quantify the nature of data collapse. Via a minimization of this measure, the exponents and their error-bars can be obtained. The procedure is illustrated by considering finite-size-scaling near phase transitions and quite strikingly recovering the exact exponents.},

abstract = {We have studied experimentally transport properties in a slowly driven granular system which recently was shown to display self-organized criticality [Frette {\{}$\backslash$em et al., Nature{\}} {\{}$\backslash$bf 379{\}}, 49 (1996)]. Tracer particles were added to a pile and their transit times measured. The distribution of transit times is a constant with a crossover to a decaying power law. The average transport velocity decreases with system size. This is due to an increase in the active zone depth with system size. The relaxation processes generate coherently moving regions of grains mixed with convection. This picture is supported by considering transport in a {\$}1D{\$} cellular automaton modeling the experiment.},

abstract = {In this paper we present the Low Frequency Instrument (LFI), designed and developed as part of the Planck space mission, the ESA program dedicated to precision imaging of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Planck-LFI will observe the full sky in intensity and polarisation in three frequency bands centred at 30, 44 and 70 GHz, while higher frequencies (100-850 GHz) will be covered by the HFI instrument. The LFI is an array of microwave radiometers based on state-of-the-art Indium Phosphide cryogenic HEMT amplifiers implemented in a differential system using blackbody loads as reference signals. The front-end is cooled to 20K for optimal sensitivity and the reference loads are cooled to 4K to minimise low frequency noise. We provide an overview of the LFI, discuss the leading scientific requirements and describe the design solutions adopted for the various hardware subsystems. The main drivers of the radiometric, optical and thermal design are discussed, including the stringent requirements on sensitivity, stability, and rejection of systematic effects. Further details on the key instrument units and the results of ground calibration are provided in a set of companion papers.},

We use the fact that the stationary state of this sandpile model is hyperuniform to reach system of sizes {\$}{\textgreater} 10{\^{}}7{\$}. Most previous simulations were seriously flawed by important finite size corrections. We find that all critical exponents have values consistent with simple rationals: {\$}\backslashnu=4/3{\$} for the correlation length exponent, {\$}D =9/4{\$} for the fractal dimension of avalanche clusters, and {\$}z=10/7 {\$} for the dynamical exponent. In addition we relate the hyperuniformity exponent to the correlation length exponent {\$}\backslashnu{\$}. Finally we discuss the relationship with the quenched Edwards-Wilkinson (qEW) model, where we find in particular that the local roughness exponent is {\$}\backslashalpha{\_}{\{}\backslashrm loc{\}} = 1{\$}.},

We found that the avalanche exponent depends crucially on whether one drives the system in the bulk or at the boundary while the cutoff scaling exponent is invariant. Scaling relations relating these exponents are derived for various modes of driving. It is shown numerically that the one dimensional Manna model and a recently introduced ricepile model have the same exponents. Finally, a class of nonconserved self-organized critical models is introduced, and a classification scheme for sandpile models is proposed.},

abstract = {Using DIRBE and FIRAS maps at high latitude ({\$}|b|{\textgreater}10{\^{}}{\{}\backslashcirc{\}}{\$}) we derive the spatial distribution of the dust temperature associated with the diffuse cirrus and the dense molecular clouds. For a {\$}\nu{\^{}}2{\$} emissivity law, we find that the equilibrium dust temperature of the cirrus is about 17.5 K with only small variations over the high latitude sky. Comparison of the far Infrared DIRBE maps shows the presence of a colder emission component with a temperature around 15 K, assuming a {\$}\nu{\^{}}2{\$} emissivity law. The lowest values of the temperature found in the cold regions ({\$}{\~{}}13 K{\$}) are compatible with the results recently obtained for dense cores in star forming regions by the balloon-borne experiment SPM-PRONAOS (Ristorcelli et al., 1996, 1998, Serra et al., 1997). This cold component is in particular present in the direction of known molecular complexes with low star forming activity such as Taurus. The association between the cold component and molecular clouds is further demonstrated by the fact that all sky pixels with significant cold emission have an excess IR emission with respect to the high latitude IR/HI correlation. We have deduced a threshold value of the column density, {\$}N{\_}{\{}HI{\}} = 2.5 10{\^{}}{\{}20{\}} H/cm{\^{}}2{\$}, below which cold dust is not detected within the FIRAS beam of {\$}{\~{}}7\backslashdegr{\$}. We have re-examined the problem of the existence of a very cold dust component ({\$}T {\~{}}7 K{\$}) by combining DIRBE maps of the cold emission with FIRAS spectra, corrected for the isotropic component found in Puget et al. (1996). The warm and cold component deduced from the analysis of DIRBE maps account for the Galactic FIRAS spectra with no need for a very cold component ({\$}T{\~{}}7{\$} K).},

abstract = {Large scale simulations of a rice-pile model are performed. We use moment analysis techniques to evaluate critical exponents and data collapse method to verify the obtained results. The moment analysis yields well-defined avalanche exponents, which show that the rice-pile model can be coherently described within a finite size scaling frame-work. The general picture resulting from our analysis allows us to characterize the large scale behavior of the present model with great accuracy. {\textcopyright} International Academic Publishers.},

@misc{Frette1996,
abstract = {The idea of self-organized criticality(1) (SOC) is commonly illustrated conceptually with avalanches in a pile of sand grains. The grains are dropped onto a pile one by one, and the pile ultimately reaches a stationary 'critical' state in which its slope fluctuates about a constant angle of repose, with each new grain being capable of inducing an avalanche on any of the relevant size scales. Some numerical models of sand-pile dynamics do show SOC1-8, but the behaviour of real sand piles remains ambiguous(9-18). Here we describe experiments on a granular system--a pile of rice-in which the dynamics exhibit self-organized critical behaviour in one case (for grains with a large aspect ratio) but not in another (for less elongated grains). These results show that SOC is not as 'universal' and insensitive to the details of a system as was initially supposed(1), but that instead its occurrence depends on the detailed mechanism of energy dissipation.},

This volume limited, K-band selected sample is composed of galaxies spanning the whole range of morphological types (from ellipticals to late-type spirals) and environments (from the field to the centre of the Virgo Cluster). We present flux density measurements of the whole sample of 323 galaxies of the HRS in the three bands of the Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE), at 250, 350 and 500 microns. Aperture photometry is performed on extended galaxies and point spread function (PSF) fitting on timeline data for unresolved objects; we carefully estimate errors and upper limits. The flux densities are found to be in good agreement with those of the HeViCS and KINGFISH key projects in all SPIRE bands, and of the Planck consortium at 350 and 550 microns, for the galaxies in common. This submillimetre catalogue of nearby galaxies is a benchmark for the study of the dust properties in the local universe, giving the zero redshift reference for any cosmological survey.},

abstract = {The Oslo rice pile model is a sandpile-like paradigmatic model of ``Self-Organized Criticality'' (SOC). In this paper it is shown that the Oslo model is in fact exactly a discrete realization of the much studied quenched Edwards-Wilkinson equation (qEW) [Nattermann et al., J. Phys. II France 2, 1483 (1992)]. This is possible by choosing the correct dynamical variable and identifying its equation of motion. It establishes for the first time an exact link between SOC models and the field of interface growth with quenched disorder. This connection is obviously very encouraging as it suggests that established theoretical techniques can be brought to bear with full strength on some of the hitherto elusive problems of SOC.},

abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) programme within the ESA Planck mission. The LFI instrument has been developed to produce high precision maps of the microwave sky at frequencies in the range 27-77 GHz, below the peak of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation spectrum. The scientific goals are described, ranging from fundamental cosmology to Galactic and extragalactic astrophysics. The instrument design and development are outlined, together with the model philosophy and testing strategy. The instrument is presented in the context of the Planck mission. The LFI approach to ground and inflight calibration is described. We also describe the LFI ground segment. We present the results of a number of tests demonstrating the capability of the LFI data processing centre (DPC) to properly reduce and analyse LFI flight data, from telemetry information to calibrated and cleaned time ordered data, sky maps at each frequency (in temperature and polarization), component emission maps (CMB and diffuse foregrounds), catalogs for various classes of sources (the Early Release Compact Source Catalogue and the Final Compact Source Catalogue). The organization of the LFI consortium is briefly presented as well as the role of the core team in data analysis and scientific exploitation. All tests carried out on the LFI flight model demonstrate the excellent performance of the instrument and its various subunits. The data analysis pipeline has been tested and its main steps verified. In the first three months after launch, the commissioning, calibration, performance, and verification phases will be completed, after which Planck will begin its operational life, in which LFI will have an integral part.},

@article{Bianchi2013a,
abstract = {I show here that the bulk of the dust mass in a galaxy can be equivalently estimated from: i) the full spectral energy distribution of dust emission, using the approach of Draine {\&} Lee (2007) that includes a distribution of dust grains and a range of interstellar radiation field intensities; ii) the emission in the wavelength range 100um {\textless}= lambda {\textless}= 500um (covered by the Herschel Space Observatory), by fitting to the data a simpler single temperature modified blackbody. Recent claims on the contrary (Dale et al. 2012) should be interpreted as a caveat to use in the simpler fits an absorption cross section which is consistent both in the normalization and in the spectral index beta with that of the full dust model. I also show that the dust mass does not depend significantly on the choice of beta, if both the dust mass and the absorption cross section are derived with the same assumption on beta.},
