abstract = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution—the part of the distribution representing large but rare events— and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data while in others the power law is ruled out.},

@article{Bianchi2013a,
abstract = {I show here that the bulk of the dust mass in a galaxy can be equivalently estimated from: i) the full spectral energy distribution of dust emission, using the approach of Draine {\&} Lee (2007) that includes a distribution of dust grains and a range of interstellar radiation field intensities; ii) the emission in the wavelength range 100um {\textless}= lambda {\textless}= 500um (covered by the Herschel Space Observatory), by fitting to the data a simpler single temperature modified blackbody. Recent claims on the contrary (Dale et al. 2012) should be interpreted as a caveat to use in the simpler fits an absorption cross section which is consistent both in the normalization and in the spectral index beta with that of the full dust model. I also show that the dust mass does not depend significantly on the choice of beta, if both the dust mass and the absorption cross section are derived with the same assumption on beta.},

abstract = {We present a multifrequency dataset for an optically-selected, volume-limited, complete sample of 118 late-type galaxies ({\textgreater}= S0a) in the Virgo cluster. The database includes UV, visible, near-IR, mid-IR, far-IR, radio continuum photometric data as well as spectroscopic data of Halpha, CO and HI lines, homogeneously reduced, obtained from our own observations or compiled from the literature. Assuming the energy balance between the absorbed stellar light and that radiated in the IR by dust, we calibarte an empirical attenuation law suitable for correcting photometric and spectroscopic data of normal galaxies. The data, corrected for internal extinction, are used to construct the spectral energy distribution (SED) of each individual galaxy, and combined to trace the median SED of galaxies in various classes of morphological type and luminosity. Low-luminosity, dwarf galaxies have on average bluer stellar continua and higher far-IR luminosities per unit galaxy mass than giant, early-type spirals. If compared to nearby starburst galaxies such as M82 and Arp 220, normal spirals have relatively similar observed stellar spectra but 10-100 times lower IR luminosities. The temperature of the cold dust component increases with the far-IR luminosity, from giant spirals to dwarf irregulars. The SED are used to separate the stellar emission from the dust emission in the mid-IR regime. We show that the contribution of the stellar emission at 6.75 micron to the total emission of galaxies is generally important, from {\~{}} 80{\%} in Sa to {\~{}} 20{\%} in Sc.},

The obtained result P(k, t) is the time evolution of degree distribution. P(k, t) is composed of two terms. At given finite time, one term decays exponentially, the other reflects size effect. At infinite time, the degree distribution is the same as that of Barab{\'{a}}s and Albert.

abstract = {In this paper we present the Low Frequency Instrument (LFI), designed and developed as part of the Planck space mission, the ESA program dedicated to precision imaging of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Planck-LFI will observe the full sky in intensity and polarisation in three frequency bands centred at 30, 44 and 70 GHz, while higher frequencies (100-850 GHz) will be covered by the HFI instrument. The LFI is an array of microwave radiometers based on state-of-the-art Indium Phosphide cryogenic HEMT amplifiers implemented in a differential system using blackbody loads as reference signals. The front-end is cooled to 20K for optimal sensitivity and the reference loads are cooled to 4K to minimise low frequency noise. We provide an overview of the LFI, discuss the leading scientific requirements and describe the design solutions adopted for the various hardware subsystems. The main drivers of the radiometric, optical and thermal design are discussed, including the stringent requirements on sensitivity, stability, and rejection of systematic effects. Further details on the key instrument units and the results of ground calibration are provided in a set of companion papers.},

This model involves only a small number of parameters, called log- size and log-log growth rate. These parameters capture some universal characteristics of massive graphs. Furthermore, from these parame- ters, various properties of the graph can be derived. For example, for certain ranges of the parameters, we will compute the expected distri- bution of the sizes of the connected components which almost surely occur with high probability. We will illustrate the consistency of our model with the behavior of some massive graphs derived from data in telecommunications. We will also discuss the threshold function, the giant component, and the evolution of random graphs in this model.},

abstract = {We have analysed some structural properties of scale-free networks with the same degree distribution. Departing from a degree distribution obtained from the Barab$\backslash$'asi-Albert (BA) algorithm, networks were generated using four additional different algorithms a (Molloy-Reed, Kalisky, and two new models named A and B) besides the BA algorithm itself. For each network, we have calculated the following structural measures: average degree of the nearest neighbours, central point dominance, clustering coefficient, the Pearson correlation coefficient, and global efficiency. We found that different networks with the same degree distribution may have distinct structural properties. In particular, model B generates decentralized networks with a larger number of components, a smaller giant component size, and a low global efficiency when compared to the other algorithms, especially compared to the centralized BA networks that have all vertices in a single component, with a medium to high global efficiency. The other three models generate networks with intermediate characteristics between B and BA models. A consequence of this finding is that the dynamics of different phenomena on these networks may differ considerably.},

abstract = {The idea of self-organized criticality(1) (SOC) is commonly illustrated conceptually with avalanches in a pile of sand grains. The grains are dropped onto a pile one by one, and the pile ultimately reaches a stationary 'critical' state in which its slope fluctuates about a constant angle of repose, with each new grain being capable of inducing an avalanche on any of the relevant size scales. Some numerical models of sand-pile dynamics do show SOC1-8, but the behaviour of real sand piles remains ambiguous(9-18). Here we describe experiments on a granular system--a pile of rice-in which the dynamics exhibit self-organized critical behaviour in one case (for grains with a large aspect ratio) but not in another (for less elongated grains). These results show that SOC is not as 'universal' and insensitive to the details of a system as was initially supposed(1), but that instead its occurrence depends on the detailed mechanism of energy dissipation.},

abstract = {Using DIRBE and FIRAS maps at high latitude ({\$}|b|{\textgreater}10{\^{}}{\{}\backslashcirc{\}}{\$}) we derive the spatial distribution of the dust temperature associated with the diffuse cirrus and the dense molecular clouds. For a {\$}\nu{\^{}}2{\$} emissivity law, we find that the equilibrium dust temperature of the cirrus is about 17.5 K with only small variations over the high latitude sky. Comparison of the far Infrared DIRBE maps shows the presence of a colder emission component with a temperature around 15 K, assuming a {\$}\nu{\^{}}2{\$} emissivity law. The lowest values of the temperature found in the cold regions ({\$}{\~{}}13 K{\$}) are compatible with the results recently obtained for dense cores in star forming regions by the balloon-borne experiment SPM-PRONAOS (Ristorcelli et al., 1996, 1998, Serra et al., 1997). This cold component is in particular present in the direction of known molecular complexes with low star forming activity such as Taurus. The association between the cold component and molecular clouds is further demonstrated by the fact that all sky pixels with significant cold emission have an excess IR emission with respect to the high latitude IR/HI correlation. We have deduced a threshold value of the column density, {\$}N{\_}{\{}HI{\}} = 2.5 10{\^{}}{\{}20{\}} H/cm{\^{}}2{\$}, below which cold dust is not detected within the FIRAS beam of {\$}{\~{}}7\backslashdegr{\$}. We have re-examined the problem of the existence of a very cold dust component ({\$}T {\~{}}7 K{\$}) by combining DIRBE maps of the cold emission with FIRAS spectra, corrected for the isotropic component found in Puget et al. (1996). The warm and cold component deduced from the analysis of DIRBE maps account for the Galactic FIRAS spectra with no need for a very cold component ({\$}T{\~{}}7{\$} K).},

abstract = {The Oslo rice pile model is a sandpile-like paradigmatic model of ``Self-Organized Criticality'' (SOC). In this paper it is shown that the Oslo model is in fact exactly a discrete realization of the much studied quenched Edwards-Wilkinson equation (qEW) [Nattermann et al., J. Phys. II France 2, 1483 (1992)]. This is possible by choosing the correct dynamical variable and identifying its equation of motion. It establishes for the first time an exact link between SOC models and the field of interface growth with quenched disorder. This connection is obviously very encouraging as it suggests that established theoretical techniques can be brought to bear with full strength on some of the hitherto elusive problems of SOC.},

abstract = {The Herschel Reference Survey (HRS) is a guaranteed time Herschel key project aimed at studying the physical properties of the interstellar medium in galaxies of the nearby universe. This volume limited, K-band selected sample is composed of galaxies spanning the whole range of morphological types (from ellipticals to late-type spirals) and environments (from the field to the centre of the Virgo Cluster). We present flux density measurements of the whole sample of 323 galaxies of the HRS in the three bands of the Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE), at 250, 350 and 500 microns. Aperture photometry is performed on extended galaxies and point spread function (PSF) fitting on timeline data for unresolved objects; we carefully estimate errors and upper limits. The flux densities are found to be in good agreement with those of the HeViCS and KINGFISH key projects in all SPIRE bands, and of the Planck consortium at 350 and 550 microns, for the galaxies in common. This submillimetre catalogue of nearby galaxies is a benchmark for the study of the dust properties in the local universe, giving the zero redshift reference for any cosmological survey.},

Tracer particles were added to a pile and their transit times measured. The distribution of transit times is a constant with a crossover to a decaying power law. The average transport velocity decreases with system size. This is due to an increase in the active zone depth with system size. The relaxation processes generate coherently moving regions of grains mixed with convection. This picture is supported by considering transport in a {\$}1D{\$} cellular automaton modeling the experiment.},

abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) programme within the ESA Planck mission. The LFI instrument has been developed to produce high precision maps of the microwave sky at frequencies in the range 27-77 GHz, below the peak of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation spectrum. The scientific goals are described, ranging from fundamental cosmology to Galactic and extragalactic astrophysics. The instrument design and development are outlined, together with the model philosophy and testing strategy. The instrument is presented in the context of the Planck mission. The LFI approach to ground and inflight calibration is described. We also describe the LFI ground segment. We present the results of a number of tests demonstrating the capability of the LFI data processing centre (DPC) to properly reduce and analyse LFI flight data, from telemetry information to calibrated and cleaned time ordered data, sky maps at each frequency (in temperature and polarization), component emission maps (CMB and diffuse foregrounds), catalogs for various classes of sources (the Early Release Compact Source Catalogue and the Final Compact Source Catalogue). The organization of the LFI consortium is briefly presented as well as the role of the core team in data analysis and scientific exploitation. All tests carried out on the LFI flight model demonstrate the excellent performance of the instrument and its various subunits. The data analysis pipeline has been tested and its main steps verified. In the first three months after launch, the commissioning, calibration, performance, and verification phases will be completed, after which Planck will begin its operational life, in which LFI will have an integral part.},

We measure the spectral energy distribution (SED) from 100 to 500 um and derive dust temperatures and dust masses. The SEDs are fitted by a cool component of temperature T {\textless} 20 K, implying dust masses around 10{\^{}}{\{}5{\}} M{\_}{\{}sun{\}} and dust-to-gas ratios D within the range 10{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}-10{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}. The completion of the full survey will yield a larger set of galaxies, which will provide more stringent constraints on the dust content of star-forming dwarf galaxies.},

We propose a measure to quantify the nature of data collapse. Via a minimization of this measure, the exponents and their error-bars can be obtained. The procedure is illustrated by considering finite-size-scaling near phase transitions and quite strikingly recovering the exact exponents.},

abstract = {Systems as diverse as genetic networks or the World Wide Web are best described as networks with complex topology. A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mech- anisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},

In this paper, we perform a comparative study of six state of the art, English-based semantic similarity techniques and evaluate their effectiveness on words from the comments and identifiers in software. Our results suggest that applying English-based semantic similarity techniques to software without any customization could be detrimental to the performance of the client software tools.

abstract = {Many man-made and natural phenomena, including the intensity of earthquakes, population of cities and size of international wars, are believed to follow power-law distributions. The accurate identification of power-law patterns has significant consequences for correctly un-derstanding and modeling complex systems. However, statistical evi-dence for or against the power-law hypothesis is complicated by large fluctuations in the empirical distribution's tail, and these are wors-ened when information is lost from binning the data. We adapt the statistically principled framework for testing the power-law hypothe-sis, developed by Clauset, Shalizi and Newman, to the case of binned data. This approach includes maximum-likelihood fitting, a hypoth-esis test based on the Kolmogorov–Smirnov goodness-of-fit statistic and likelihood ratio tests for comparing against alternative explana-tions. We evaluate the effectiveness of these methods on synthetic binned data with known structure, quantify the loss of statistical power due to binning, and apply the methods to twelve real-world binned data sets with heavy-tailed patterns.},

abstract = {Classical mathematical probability focuses on time-asymptotics, describing what happens if some random process runs for ever. In contrast, the word problems each ask “how long until a chain does something?”, and the focus of this book is on finite-time behavior. More precisely, the word problems ask about hitting times, the time until a state or a set of states is first visited, or until each state in a set is visited; or ask about mixing times, the number of steps until the distribution is approximately the stationary distribution. The card-shuffling problems (section 1.1.4) provide a very intuitive setting for such questions; how many shuffles are needed, as a function of the size of the deck, until the deck is well shuffled? Such size-asymptotic results, of which (1.1) is perhaps the best-known, are one of the themes of this book. Thus in one sense our work is in the spirit of the birthday and coupon-collector's problems in undergraduate probability; in another sense our goals are reminiscent of those of computational complexity (P =? NP and all that), which seeks to relate the time required to solve an algorithmic problem to the size of the problem.},

@article{Cuenda2011,
abstract = {We give an intuitive though general explanation of the finite-size effect in scale-free networks in terms of the degree distribution of the starting network. This result clarifies the relevance of the starting network in the final degree distribution. We use two different approaches: the deterministic mean-field approximation used by Barab$\backslash$'asi and Albert (but taking into account the nodes of the starting network), and the probability distribution of the degree of each node, which considers the stochastic process. Numerical simulations show that the accuracy of the predictions of the mean-field approximation depend on the contribution of the dispersion in the final distribution. The results in terms of the probability distribution of the degree of each node are very accurate when compared to numerical simulations. The analysis of the standard deviation of the degree distribution allows us to assess the influence of the starting core when fitting the model to real data.},
