{\bf Abstract:} In this report, we investigate the degree distribution of the Barab\'asi-Albert (BA) Model and 2 other related variants, namely the random attachment and preferential attachment through random walks. We derive the degree distribution and the theoretical largest expected degree, $k_1$, for preferential and random attachment and compare it against numerical simulation. Agreement of the numerical results with the theoretical model is investigated using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The degree distribution of the random walk model is compared with the scaled free behaviour of the BA model and also with the geometric degree distribution of the random attachment model.
