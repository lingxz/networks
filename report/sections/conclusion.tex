The degree distributions of the BA preferential attachment model, random attachment model, and random walk model have been studied. The degree distribution for preferential attachment is a scale free power law, but this is not the case for random attachment, which is a geometric distribution. Numerical simulation results were compared with the values predicted by theory and found to be in agreement.
