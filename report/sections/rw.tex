\section{Random walks and preferential attachment}\label{section:random-walk}

\subsection{Theoretical degree distribution}
One of the weaknesses of the BA model and its generalizations is that this implicitly requires a knowledge of the total degree and a calculation across existing vertices on the graph. This requirements then destroys the potential for this model to exhibit emergent properties based on local behaviour. The attachment by performing a random walk is a solution proposed by \citet{Saramaki2004}. In this model, a vertex is chosen at random from existing vertices and then executes a random walk of length $L$ from that vertex. The new vertex then attaches to the destination vertex. 

This model was thought to be able to reproduce the BA degree distribution even for $L=1$ \citep{Saramaki2004,J.P.Saramaki2004}. While this is the case for large $L$, \citet{Cannings2013} later showed that the $L=1$ degree sequence converges to a degenerate limiting solution in which almost every vertex has degree 1, instead of a power law distribution, and demonstrated that this model is fundamentally different from the BA model, unless we allow an indefinite length for the random walk. For $L = 0$, this reduces to the random attachment model.
